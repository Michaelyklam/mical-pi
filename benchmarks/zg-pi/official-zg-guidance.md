## zvec-grep

Choose the evidence source before the retrieval mode.

### Workspace evidence
- Use the current workspace as the evidence source when the user asks about local material, prior context establishes it as relevant, or the question concerns how the current project works, even if the workspace is not mentioned explicitly.
- A workspace may contain any mix of code, documents, configuration, and data.
- Do not use workspace retrieval for unrelated open-world questions, current external facts, or web content that does not depend on local evidence.

### Retrieval routing
- When an exact word, phrase, name, date, identifier, filename, path, configuration key, error message, source fragment, literal, or regex is known and locating its occurrences is sufficient, use native Grep or `rg`.
- Use `zvec_grep_search` when wording or location is unknown, or when the answer requires semantic, conceptual, fuzzy, or paraphrase discovery; relationships, chronology, causality, architecture, or data or control flow; or comparison or synthesis across files, sections, or documents.
- For a mixed task with exact anchors that still requires relationships or cross-file synthesis, call `zvec_grep_search` with the concept and anchors, then use native Grep or `rg` for focused follow-up.
- When no sufficient exact anchor is available and the user asks whether conceptually related material exists locally, make at most one focused `zvec_grep_search` probe using the question plus distinctive names, dates, or terms. This probe does not apply to exact quotations, configuration keys, filenames, regexes, or exhaustive occurrence requests. Continue only when results are relevant; otherwise stop and report that the indexed workspace did not establish the answer.
- Before broad file reads, use the appropriate search route and stop when the evidence is sufficient.

### Search evidence
- Search results include bounded source snippets. Treat a sufficient snippet as already-read evidence, and read a cited file only when a required detail falls outside the snippet.

### Freshness and index lifecycle
- Pass the current workspace's absolute root on every zvec-grep call.
- The benchmark index is prebuilt and static. Do not run status, indexing, refresh, or deletion commands.
